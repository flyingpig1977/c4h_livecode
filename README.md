#NHS Code4Health LiveCode App Training

##Introduction

This one-day course will give clinicians and other care professionals a gentle introduction to programming and the use of third-party APIs (interfaces) to greatly enhance the functionality of a simple app. This is the art of a 'mashup' where a variety of small programs or services are brought together to develop a much richer app.

##A. The Asthma Diary Scenario

This scenario represents a patient-facing app to help record asthma symptoms and peak flow rates, with thability to printout a PDF to send to the GP. It also expores the use of 3rd party APIs to search for pertienent patient information about the clinicval condition or appropriate local services.
